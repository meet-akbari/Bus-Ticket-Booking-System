# Bus-Ticket-Booking-System
- A C programming based application developed to help end users for booking tickets to travel through Intercity Bus Service.

- This Proposed Project is designed in C programming language as the End semester Project of my 1st Semester of B.Tech.

- To run this project first download all the files which are under this Bus-Management-System Project folder and paste it in your PC within one folder.

- Then open the Code_Bus_Management_System.c file in your C compilor and build and run it, all other .txt and header files will be managed automatically.

- User Interface is easily understandable even if you are not a programmer, just read and follow the instructions carefully given on every screen of application.

- Thank you for downloading Bus Management System, Enjoy your valuable Day :)
